# Retro Games

This repository contains a few retro games. These games were developed using Reactjs.

Up to now, the games are:

- [Memory Game](https://silly-shaw-01b5a1.netlify.app/memory-game)
- [Whack A Mole!](https://silly-shaw-01b5a1.netlify.app/whack-a-mole)
- [Connect Four](https://silly-shaw-01b5a1.netlify.app/connect-four)
- [Snake](https://silly-shaw-01b5a1.netlify.app/snake)
- [Space Invaders](https://silly-shaw-01b5a1.netlify.app/space-invaders)
- [Frogger]() under construction
- [Tetris]() under construction

My inspiration to create this repo was [kubowania](https://github.com/kubowania). She developed all this game using Vanilla Javascript, but I decide recreate using the library React and styled-components.

The repo is hosted in [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), you can access it and have fun.
